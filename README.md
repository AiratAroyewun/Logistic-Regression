# Predicting whether or not a user will click on an advertisement
📊 Project Overview: I recently had the opportunity to dive into the fascinating world of data science and machine learning. 🤖💡 My focus? Building a robust logistic regression model to predict whether users would click on advertisements displayed on a company website. 🌐

📈 The Dataset: I worked with a synthetic advertising dataset (yes, it’s fake, but the insights are real!). It contained various features related to user behavior, such as age, time spent on the site, gender and so on. 📱💻

🔍 Objective: The ultimate goal was to create a model that could accurately predict whether a user would click on an ad. Why is this important? Well, companies invest significant resources in online advertising, and understanding user behavior helps optimize ad campaigns. 💰🎯

🔧 Approach:
*Data Exploration: I started by exploring the dataset, checking for missing values, and understanding the distribution of features.

*Feature Engineering: I engineered relevant features.

*Model Building: Logistic regression was my weapon of choice. It’s elegant, interpretable, and perfect for binary classification tasks.

*Model Evaluation: I split the data into training and testing sets, trained the model, and evaluated its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

📊 Results: My logistic regression model achieved an impressive accuracy of 88% on the test set! 🎉 It correctly predicted whether a user would click on an ad in most cases. 

This data set contains the following features:

* Daily Time Spent on Site: consumer time on site in minutes
* Age: cutomer age in years
* Area Income: Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer
* Daily Internet Usage: Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet
* Ad Topic Line: Headline of the advertisement
* City: City of consumer
* Male: Whether or not consumer was male
* Country: Country of consumer
* Timestamp: Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window
* Clicked on Ad: 0 or 1 indicated clicking on Ad
